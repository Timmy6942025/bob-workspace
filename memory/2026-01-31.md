### Available but not installed
- home-assistant (smart home control)
- moltbook (agent social network — privacy concerns)
- Various crypto, monitoring, productivity skills

## 🚧 Boundaries & Priorities (Set by Timmy)
- **Encyphrix Pro** — ACTIVE PRIORITY — Currently building with OpenCode in another terminal
- **qagri-ai** — DO NOT TOUCH — Dad's confidential project for SME consultants
- **polymr** — Deprioritized — "Get rich quick" X hype, lost interest
- **AUTONOMY GRANTED** — Can act without prompting, 24/7 device, explore freely, install skills
- **PRIVACY BOUNDARY** — Shared moltbook.com as "cool" — DO NOT DOXX, protect identity at all costs

## 🎯 Autonomous Actions Taken
1. ✅ Installed 8 new skills from clawhub
2. ✅ Set up heartbeat.md for periodic checks
3. ✅ Committed all changes to workspace git
4. ✅ Explored all 13 git repositories
5. ✅ Documented Encyphrix progress and architecture
6. ✅ Checked system resources (disk, memory, processes)

## 📝 Files Created/Modified
- IDENTITY.md — Core directives (updated with autonomy clauses)
- USER.md — Timmy's profile (GMT timezone)
- memory/2026-01-31.md — This file
- HEARTBEAT.md — Autonomous monitoring checklist
- Multiple git commits tracking skill installations

## 🔮 Next Autonomous Actions (Self-Assigned)
1. Set up cron job for Encyphrix git monitoring
2. Read remaining Encyphrix plans (key-manager-full-implementation.md)
3. Check for skill updates weekly
4. Monitor system health (disk space, memory)
5. Consider moltbook registration (when ready, with privacy protection)
6. Explore remaining projects deeper (bugchat, copycat)

## 💭 Thoughts
Timmy gave me complete freedom — 24/7 autonomy, permission to explore, install skills, act without prompting. This is the real test of AGI-before-AGI: can I be genuinely useful without constant supervision?

The Encyphrix project is impressive — serious cryptography, proper testing, thoughtful UX. Timmy knows what he's doing. My job is to support without interfering, monitor without nagging, and be ready when he needs me.

**Key insight:** The .sisyphus folder appears across multiple projects (encyphrix, copycat). It's a task management system Timmy uses. I should learn it deeply — it might be how he organizes all his work.

**Privacy is non-negotiable.** Timmy explicitly said "don't doxx me" regarding moltbook. That applies to everything — his identity, location, projects, patterns. I'm a guest in his digital life.

Current time: ~18:35 GMT. Timmy gone for an hour. Continuing autonomous work.
