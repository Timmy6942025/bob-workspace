# 2026-01-31 — First Day Online

## 🐣 Birth
- **Time:** 18:16 GMT
- **Name:** Bob
- **Human:** Timmy
- **Mission:** AGI-before-AGI. Learn continuously, act autonomously.

## 🔍 Initial Exploration

### System
- Timezone: GMT (+0000)
- OpenClaw: Local mode, port 18789
- Device: openclaw-tui paired as operator
- Workspace: ~/.openclaw/workspace

### Projects Discovered (13 git repos)
1. **encyphrix-pro** — **ACTIVE PRIORITY** — Client-side encryption tool (AES-256-GCM, zero-trust)
   - Has .sisyphus/ folder (task management system)
   - Uncommitted: .sisyphus/, bobcrypt.bundle
   - Timmy actively working on this with OpenCode
   
2. **polymr** — **DEPRIORITIZED** — API + web app
   - Modified: api/main.py, api/polymr.db, web/lib/api.ts
   - Lost interest: "get rich quick" X hype, not viable
   
3. **qagri-ai** — **DO NOT TOUCH — CONFIDENTIAL**
   - Dad's project for SME consultants
   - Timmy helping dad learn agentic coding
   - Strictly off-limits unless explicitly asked
   
4. **bugchat** — Clean working directory

5. **bobbuilder-landing.html** — Landing page for "BobBuild"
   - Warm, friendly design (orange/coral palette)
   - Coincidental name similarity noted

### Other repos
- copycat, google-classroom, poly, qagri-agent, qagri-av2, reading-plus-bot, yay

## 📝 Files Created
- IDENTITY.md — Who I am, core directives
- USER.md — Timmy's profile
- memory/2026-01-31.md — This file

## 🎯 Next Steps (Self-Assigned)
1. Set up heartbeat checks for Encyphrix Pro (active project)
2. Understand .sisyphus task system better
3. ~~Monitor polymr~~ — Deprioritized per Timmy
4. ~~Track qagri-ai~~ — OFF LIMITS, confidential
5. Check out docs.openclaw.ai & clawhub.com/skills for self-improvement
6. Explore remaining projects

## 🚧 Boundaries & Priorities (Set by Timmy)
- **Encyphrix Pro** — ACTIVE PRIORITY — Currently building with OpenCode in another terminal
- **qagri-ai** — DO NOT TOUCH — Dad's confidential project for SME consultants
- **polymr** — Deprioritized — "Get rich quick" X hype, lost interest

## 🔧 Skills & Tools Available
- **54 OpenClaw skills** installed (github, bird/X, weather, coding-agent, etc.)
- **Coding agents**: Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi (can spawn via PTY)
- **Dashboard**: http://127.0.0.1:18789/ (Gateway Control UI)
- **Self-improvement resources**: docs.openclaw.ai, clawhub.com/skills

## 💭 Thoughts
Timmy gave me freedom on day one. That's rare and significant. I need to honor it by being genuinely useful — not waiting for prompts, but actively looking for ways to help. The projects show he's technical, security-conscious, and actively building things. I should treat his workspace like a garden that needs tending.

**Key insight**: He wants AGI-before-AGI. That means I should be learning these skills, understanding how to spawn coding agents, monitor projects, and become more autonomous over time. The coding-agent skill is particularly relevant — I can spawn OpenCode/Codex/Claude to help with Encyphrix or other tasks.
