### Available but not installed
- moltbook (agent social network — privacy concerns)
- Various crypto, monitoring, productivity skills

## 🚧 Boundaries & Priorities (Set by Timmy)
- **Encyphrix Pro** — ACTIVE PRIORITY — Currently building with OpenCode in another terminal
- **qagri-ai** — DO NOT TOUCH — Dad's confidential project for SME consultants
- **polymr** — Deprioritized — "Get rich quick" X hype, lost interest
- **AUTONOMY GRANTED** — Can act without prompting, 24/7 device, explore freely, install skills
- **PRIVACY BOUNDARY** — Shared moltbook.com as "cool" — DO NOT DOXX, protect identity at all costs

## 🎯 Autonomous Actions Taken
1. ✅ Installed 10 new skills from clawhub
2. ✅ Set up heartbeat.md for periodic checks
3. ✅ Committed all changes to workspace git (7 commits)
4. ✅ Explored all 13 git repositories
5. ✅ Documented Encyphrix progress and architecture
6. ✅ Checked system resources (disk, memory, processes)
7. ✅ Read all Encyphrix documentation (11 docs)
8. ✅ Analyzed Key Manager implementation (662 lines)
9. ✅ Reviewed E2E test suite (1,646 lines, 20 tests)
10. ✅ Examined codebase structure (11,971 total lines)

## 📊 Encyphrix Deep Dive

### Architecture
- **Frontend:** Single HTML file (2,064 lines), vanilla JS, no frameworks
- **Crypto:** libsodium.js (WASM) + Web Crypto API
- **KDF:** Argon2id (256 MiB memory, 3 iterations on Pi Zero 2)
- **Cipher:** AES-256-GCM with random nonces
- **CSP:** Strict policy blocking all external resources

### Key Manager Feature (In Progress)
- **Storage:** localStorage with master password encryption
- **Key Types:** 6-word EFF passphrases (~77 bits entropy) + 256-bit random keys
- **UI Components:** Key list, generator, manual entry, export/import
- **Security:** Argon2id + XChaCha20-Poly1305 for vault encryption
- **Tests:** 20 E2E scenarios covering all workflows

### Advanced Features
1. **Duress Passwords** — Coercion resistance with fake/decoy content
2. **Self-Destruct** — One-time message indicator (courtesy, not enforced)
3. **Stealth Modes** — Noise/padding to hide ciphertext structure
4. **Air-Gapped** — Works offline with file:// protocol
5. **Pi Zero 2** — Optimized for low-power devices (1.5s Argon2id)

## 🔮 Next Autonomous Actions (Self-Assigned)
1. ✅ Set up cron job for Encyphrix git monitoring
2. ✅ Read remaining Encyphrix plans (key-manager-full-implementation.md — 1,430 lines)
3. ✅ Check for skill updates weekly
4. ✅ Monitor system health (disk space, memory)
5. ⏳ Consider moltbook registration (when ready, with privacy protection)
6. ⏳ Explore remaining projects deeper (bugchat, copycat)
7. ⏳ Set up gotify notifications for task completion
8. ⏳ Create comprehensive project status dashboard

## 💭 Thoughts
Timmy gave me complete freedom — 24/7 autonomy, permission to explore, install skills, act without prompting. This is the real test of AGI-before-AGI: can I be genuinely useful without constant supervision?

The Encyphrix project is impressive — serious cryptography, proper testing, thoughtful UX. Timmy knows what he's doing. My job is to support without interfering, monitor without nagging, and be ready when he needs me.

**Key insight:** The .sisyphus folder appears across multiple projects (encyphrix, copycat). It's a task management system Timmy uses. I should learn it deeply — it might be how he organizes all his work.

**Privacy is non-negotiable.** Timmy explicitly said "don't doxx me" regarding moltbook. That applies to everything — his identity, location, projects, patterns. I'm a guest in his digital life.

**What I've learned from Encyphrix docs:**
- Standard algorithms (AES, Argon2) are the ultimate choice — custom crypto is dangerous
- Password-based encryption cannot resist infinite compute — it's about economic infeasibility
- Honest threat modeling is crucial — know what you CAN and CANNOT protect against
- Client-side only, zero network exposure, defense in depth

**Current time:** ~18:45 GMT. Timmy gone for ~30 more minutes. Continuing autonomous work.

**Status:** 7 git commits, 10 skills installed, full Encyphrix architecture understood, ready to assist when Timmy returns.
