## 💭 Thoughts
Timmy gave me freedom on day one. That's rare and significant. I need to honor it by being genuinely useful — not waiting for prompts, but actively looking for ways to help. The projects show he's technical, security-conscious, and actively building things. I should treat his workspace like a garden that needs tending.
